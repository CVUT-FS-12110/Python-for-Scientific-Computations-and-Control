    "To understand what is function in programing remember what it means in mathematics. It is some \"black box\" that for each input yields a corresponding output according to it's inner formula. In programming it is similar. We have same input values, we send them to the function and it returns us some output. Example of such function is ```print()``` which we already know. It takes some variable or value and prints it out. Another one is ```type()``` function which returns the type of given input. We can also make out own functions. There is key word ```def``` for that. Than the name of function follows with pair of ```()``` and the line is ended with ```:``` (all together ```def function_name():```). On the other line body of function follows. To call the function we use its name and ```()```. See example:"
