**Please note that not understanding and/or not obeying the following instructions can result in your inability to obtain the assessment from this subject.**

## Classification

The overall classification consists of 3 parts: practical assignments (max. 60 points), active work during classes (max. 10 points) and optional extra project (max. 40 points). You have to obtain at least 50 points in total.

### Class Structure
* Each class consists of:
    * 90 minutes frontal lecture
    * 90 minutes practical work on assignments
* Students are expected to complete their assignments during the practical work sessions in class

#### Practical assignments 
* You will be given 4 practical assignments during the semester to complete during class time
* Each assignment is up to 15 points
* Assignments should be completed during the 90-minute practical work session in class
* Possible maximum: 60 points
* Required minimum: 30 points

#### Extra project (optional)
* extra project
    * output: fully working implementation + basic documentation (consult with the lecturer)
    * project should represent about 40 hours of work of an average student
    * you will present your project to the lecturer at the end of the year
* possible maximum: 40 points
* required minimum: 0 points

#### Extra points (optional)
* lecturer can grant you up to 10 activity points for your proactive approach or original solution of given tasks
* possible maximum: 10 points
* required minimum: 0 points

### Final grade
* depends on the sum of all categories and fulfillment of required minimum in each category
    * possible maximum: 110 points in total
    * required minimum: 50 points in total
* if you won't have at least the required minimum in every category you will be classified with F

Grading table:

| Total sum  |  Grade |
|------------|--------|
|     >89    |    A   |

|    59-50   |    E   |
|     <50    |    F   |

## Additional information
* Assignments are to be completed during the 90-minute practical work session in class
* If you cannot finish an assignment during class time, notify the lecturer. The lecturer may grant you extra time to complete the task, but late submissions can receive a maximum of 60% of normal points
* Upload your solution via Moodle assignments feature
* Your submission has to be runnable by Python 3.x (Jupyter notebook, .py file)
* If you use different than distribution packages, provide a requirements file for easy installation of the packages via Pip
* Your code has to result in the expected output without any modification required from the lecturer (debugging, uncommenting)
* Your code needs to be commented and/or self-explanatory (final word has lecturer)
* Submission of solutions in weird formats (pictures, .txt, binary files) or solutions throwing errors will be considered as a bad joke and can result in awarding an unlimited negative number of points
* A lecturer can also award you with an undefined negative number of points if the lecturer finds your solution not original enough, or malignant in any way (final word has lecturer)
* You should be able to explain and defend your solution to prove that you are the author of the solution. Otherwise, the solution may not be accepted and you can be awarded with negative points (final word has lecturer)
