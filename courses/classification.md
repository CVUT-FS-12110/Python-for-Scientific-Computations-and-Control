**Please note that not understanding and/or not obeying the following instructions can result in your inability to obtain the assessment from this subject.**

## Classification

The overall classification consists of 3 parts: weekly assignments, one extra project and active work during classes. You have to fulfill minimal score requirements in every category and obtain at least 50 points in total. For 

#### Weekly assignments 
* you will be given 8-10 assignments during the year
* possible maximum: 80 points
* required minimum: 40 points (50%)
* The maximum number of points for late assignment cannot exceed 70 % of normal points.

#### Extra project (optional)
* extra project
    * output: fully working implementation + basic documentation (consult with the lecturer)
    * project should represent about 40 hours of work of an average student
    * you will present your project to the lecturer at the end of the year
* possible maximum: 50 points
* required minimum: 0 point (0%)

#### Extra points (optional)
* lecturer can grant you up to 5 activity points for your proactive approach or original solution of given tasks
* possible maximum: 5 points
* required minimum: 0 points (0%)

### Final grade
* depends on the sum of all categories and fulfillment of required minimum in each category
    * possible maximum: 135 points in total
    * required minimum: 50 points in total
* if you won't have at least the required minimum in every category you will be classified with F

Grading table:

| Total sum  |  Grade |
|------------|--------|
|     >89    |    A   |
|    89-80   |    B   |

|    59-50   |    E   |
|     <50    |    F   |

## Aditional information
* You should solve the task assigned by the lecturer every week. If you are unable to solve it during one week, notify the lecturer. The lecturer can grant you extra time to finish the task.
* The correct solution of all tasks during the semester can give you up to 80 points (every task can produce an equal fraction of points from this total number).
* Upload your solution via MS Teams assignments feature.
* Your submission has to be runnable by Python 3.x (Jupyter notebook, .py file)
* If you use different than distribution packages, provide a requirements file for easy installation of the packages via Pip.
* Your code has to result in the expected output without any modification required from the lecturer (debugging, uncommenting).
* Your code needs to be commented and/or self-explanatory (final word has lecturer)
* Submission of solutions in weird formats (pictures, .txt, binary files) or solutions throwing errors will be considered as a bad joke and can result in awarding an unlimited negative number of points.
* A lecturer can also award you with an undefined negative number of points if the lecturer finds your solution not original enough, or malignant in any way (final word has lecturer).
* You should be able to explain and defend your solution to prove that you are the author of the solution. Otherwise, the solution may not be accepted and you can be awarded with negative points (final word has lecturer).
