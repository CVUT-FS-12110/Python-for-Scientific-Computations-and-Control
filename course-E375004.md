1. **Python Basics 2** - functions, classes

   - study any introduction to Python classes, for example: [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp) (easy to understand) or [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) (more detailed)

1. **Game like simulations** - Pygame
    
   - study the following example:[Lecture](courses/langtons_ant.py) - detail explanation in video
        - you cannot run in jupyter - use console or any IDE
        - you need `pygame` - it can be installed via `pip`
        - the example is quite complex, but it consists only from concepts you already know. Thus you should understand it pretty easily.
   - study the another example:[Lecture](courses/pygame_bouncy_balls.py)
   - task: [Lab task 3](tasks/EN_poker_test.ipynb)
