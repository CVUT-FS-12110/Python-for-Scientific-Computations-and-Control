    "  <li>Use the Control course files and run \"simulator.py\" (folder:  <a href=\"https://github.com/CVUT-FS-12110/Python-for-Scientific-Computations-and-Control/tree/master/courses/E375004/control2\">here</a>). There is a pendulum on a cart simulation, you can press left or right key to adjust a force applied to cart in x direction.</li>\n",
    "  <li>During the lecture, we controlled the pendulum hanging down. Your goal is to design your controller which can stabilize the inverted pendulum</li>\n",
    "  <li>Add a small random distrubance, which is added to the total force applied to a cart. Add also an arrow to pygame screen which will represent the disturbance. The lenght of the arrow will be proportional to the disturbance force.\n",

    "  <li>Make graphs of x (one sublplot) and theta (second sublplot), and applied force (third subplot). Do not forget to add labels, title, grid, legend</li>\n",

    "## Bonus Points (+5)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can earn **+5 extra points** (for a total of **15 points**) if you extend the simulation and control design to stabilize a **double inverted pendulum**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this challenge, you must:\n",
    "- Adjust the equations of motion for a **cart with two linked pendulums**\n",
    "- Design a more advanced controller (e.g. hierarchical PID, nested loops, LQR or other creative strategies)\n",
    "- Demonstrate that both pendulums remain balanced **upright**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a difficult but rewarding extension â€” go for it if you're feeling confident!\n"
