    "# International space station (ISS) position logger\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that store location of ISS in a [**CSV file**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) in a real time. The program should do:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **it should create CSV file, if it does not exists already**. If the file exists, the program should append new informations at the end of the file.\n",
    "- **first line of the CSV file should be the header** - it should contain names of the columns:\n",
    "  `timestmap, datetime, latitude, longitude`\n",
    "- if program crash/stop, the csv file should reamain uncorrupted\n",
    "- the otput file should be valid CSV (every line is one log, first line is header)\n",
    "- the sampling frequency should be around 5s (how often the data our downloaded and saved in file)\n",
    "- as a source of informations use Open Notify API - http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/\n",
    "- the file should containt the following columns:\n",
    "    * timestamp\n",
    "    * human readable time and date\n",
    "    * latitude (in degrees, minutes and seconds)\n",
    "    * longitude (in degrees, minutes and seconds)\n",
    "- the csv file path should be provided at the begining of your code as `FILE_PATH = \"data.csv\"` (or any other filename you choose)\n",
    "   \n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Beware of the conversion of floating point degees to degress, minutes and seconds.\n",
    "- For human readable time and date you can use local time zone of your machine.\n",
    "- Request sampling does not need to be exactly 5s. If you keep it in +- 0.5s it is good enough.\n",
    "- İMPORTANT: you need to store data into to the file with every new sample - to prevent data lost in case of program/machine crash\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When working with files, you can use `a` (append flag): `open(FILE_PATH, \"a\")` to append on the end of the file (instead of write flag, that overrides the whole file).\n",
    "- You can use CSV library in Python, but it is not necessarry in this simple case.\n",
    "- Read carefully the assignment of this task few more times."
