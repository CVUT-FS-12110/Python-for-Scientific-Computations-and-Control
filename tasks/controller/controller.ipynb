    "  <li>Add a line or thin rectangle to pygame screen, which will represent desired position, where we want to keep the rocket. You can choose the desired x position (but it has to be inside the pygame screen)</li>\n",
    "  <li>Add an arrow to pygame screen which will represent how strong is the wind force (use the \"force_disturbance\" variable). the lenght of the arrow will be proportional to the \"force_disturbance\"</li>\n",
    "  <li>Design a controller function, which will try to keep the rocket in the desired position. Input should be the desired position and the x position of the rocket (and also your additional parameters of the controller). Output of the controller will be a force, which is added to the disturbance</li>\n",
